# Nucleotide Sequence Alignment

Nucleotide sequence alignment is a vital tool in the field of molecular biology and bioinformatics. It is the process of arranging and comparing two or more nucleotide sequences (DNA or RNA) to identify regions of similarity, which can provide valuable insights into their evolutionary relationships, functions, and structures.

The importance of nucleotide sequence alignment stems from its various applications and purposes, including:

Evolutionary studies: Sequence alignment helps identify homologous genes or regions (sequences with a shared evolutionary origin) across different species. This enables scientists to understand evolutionary relationships, trace the history of gene families, and identify conserved regions that may have critical biological functions.

Gene identification and annotation: By aligning the sequences of known genes from one organism to the genome of another, scientists can identify and annotate new genes, predict their functions, and characterize their regulatory elements.

Functional prediction: Conserved regions in aligned sequences often indicate functionally important regions, such as active sites, binding sites, or regulatory elements. Identifying these regions can provide insights into the function of uncharacterized genes and help guide experimental research.

Phylogenetic analysis: By comparing sequences from different species, researchers can build phylogenetic trees that depict the evolutionary relationships between organisms. This information is crucial for understanding the diversification of life and the mechanisms of speciation.

Molecular diagnostics and epidemiology: Sequence alignment is used to identify pathogen strains and understand their genetic diversity, enabling the development of molecular diagnostics, vaccines, and therapies. It is also vital for tracking the spread of infectious diseases and identifying the sources of outbreaks.

Structural biology: Nucleotide sequence alignment can aid in predicting the secondary and tertiary structures of RNA molecules by identifying conserved structural elements. This information is useful for understanding the function and folding of RNA molecules.

## Program Functionality

This Java program implements nucleotide sequence alignment using dynamic programming. The program takes a FASTA file containing two nucleotide sequences as input and outputs the aligned sequences along with the penalty score. Here is a detailed description of the program:

The program starts by defining four constants: MATCH, MISMATCH, GAP_OPEN, and GAP_EXTEND. These constants are used to define the scoring system for the alignment.

The program defines a main() method that takes a file name as an argument, reads the file using a parseFasta() method, and checks if there are exactly two sequences in the file. If there are, it retrieves the two sequences from the parsed sequences map, aligns the sequences using the alignSequences() method, and prints the aligned sequences along with the penalty score.

The program defines a parseFasta() method that takes a file name as an argument and returns a LinkedHashMap object that maps sequence IDs to their corresponding nucleotide sequences. The method reads the file line by line, identifies the sequence ID lines by checking if they start with the ">" character, and appends the nucleotide sequence lines to a StringBuilder object. Once the entire sequence has been read, the method adds the sequence ID and sequence to the LinkedHashMap object and moves on to the next sequence.

The program defines an AlignmentResult class that stores the aligned sequences and the penalty score. This class is used to return the result of the alignment.

The program defines an alignSequences() method that takes two nucleotide sequences as arguments and returns an AlignmentResult object. The method first initializes three matrices: dp, gap1, and gap2. The dp matrix is used to store the dynamic programming scores, while the gap1 and gap2 matrices are used to store the gap penalty scores for each sequence. The method then fills in the first row and column of the matrices with gap penalty scores. It then calculates the alignment scores for each cell in the dp matrix using dynamic programming, taking into account the match, mismatch, and gap penalty scores. Finally, the method traces back through the dp matrix to build the aligned sequences and penalty score. The aligned sequences are built by following the highest-scoring path through the matrix, while the penalty score is the final score in the bottom-right cell of the dp matrix.

The program ends by returning an AlignmentResult object containing the aligned sequences and penalty score.
